\\WHAT IS A WEBSOCKET?
WebSocket is a protocol for machine-to-machine communication that keeps a TCP connection open for bi-directional passing of information. The websocket is a connection between two computers. The connection can be used to either send or receive information from either computer. The websocket can be configured as a server or client. A websocket server listens for requests and returns a result based on the input. The server can also function as a client by sending information without a specific request


\\HOW TO INSTALL WEBSOCKETS?
The websockets package is a Python library for building WebSocket servers and clients.

pip install websockets

There are other programming languages where websocket server and client are written such as JavaScript and PHP. Websocket communication occurs over TCP so that various programming languages can seamlessly communicate. For example, a Python client can call an API running on a server with JavaScript node.js



\\WEBSOCKET SERVER
The Python websockets package is build on top of asyncio for asynchronous actions from the server as it listens for client requests. 
'server1' is a simple WebSocket server in which the API listens for a name and returns a greeting.

\\WEBSOCKET CLIENT
The websockets 'client1' sends a name and listens for a return response
